task2:

1. the train and test accuracy remains significantly low for less number of "seen" data points because for very less number of seen data points, the model is not trained efficiently for classification.
after a certain point (saturation of training) the test and train accuracy remains almost same because the model can not be trained better after that.
the test accuracy always remains smaller than test accuracy because the model might remmebers some specific noise in the test data set for which the difference in accuracy between train data set and test data set almost remains same.

2. for small train size , the train accuracy is higher and test accuracy is lower as compared to larger train size because for small train data, the model overfits and remebers the noise. hence it performs well on train data and worse on test data.

2.1 there will be no prediction, it might show a default class for every test data

task3

3.1 for small train data sets (800 datas) the accuracy of 1vr and 1v1 is almost similar 
	1vr : 71.3 %
	1v1 : 71.5 %

	for large train data sets the 1v1 performs significantly better than 1vr

	1vr : 73.8%
	1v1 : 78.8%

	1v1 is better than 1vr because in large data sets 1v1 makes multiple hyperplanes, hence the classification is better than 1v1. for small data points a single hyperplane performs almost same as compared to multiple (if required) hence the accuracy is almost same.
